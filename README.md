# 📋 CopyClip

[Test](logo.png)  
**CopyClip** is an open-source clipboard manager for Linux, inspired by the advanced clipboard features of Windows 10. Easily manage your clipboard history with intuitive controls and quick access to your most recent items.

## ✨ Features

- 🗂️ **Clipboard History**: Keep track of all copied items in reverse chronological order.
- 📌 **Pin Important Items**: Save crucial snippets by pinning them to the top of your clipboard history.
- 🎛️ **Customizable Shortcuts**: Easily configure shortcuts for quick access and management.
- 🔄 **Auto-clear on Reboot**: Automatically clear your clipboard history when you restart your computer (with an option to pin items to prevent deletion).
- 🖼️ **Simple UI**: Access your clipboard history through a clean and user-friendly interface.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

> [!CAUTION]  
> Currently, items must be manually copied from the UI to be available in `Ctrl + V`. We're actively working on resolving this issue to make the process smoother and fully integrated.
